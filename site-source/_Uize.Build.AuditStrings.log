		LIKELY INTERNATIONALIZABLE STRINGS
			A black, stormy sky is breached for a moment by a shaft of sunlight that shines down on Pedro Point\'s Shelter Cove in Pacifica. The deep green ocean is ominously flat - the calm before the storm. --- 77
			A city building, like a giant monolith, looks up to the heavens. Its matrix of windows reflect the deep blue sky with its puffy white clouds, making the building appear as no more than a skeleton. --- 217
			A gathering of tall leafless trees encircle a small blue opening of a cloudy winter sky in Metuchen, New Jersey. They seem to raise their bare branches in solemn reverence to the vast majestic sky. --- 70
			A gorgeous sunset is seen from Sweeney Ridge in San Bruno, California. A ship passes by the sun on its way into the San Francisco Bay. A highlight in the sky parallels the hillside in the foreground. --- 196
			A heavy concrete grave slab accompanied by an empty concrete vase hints at a rather bleak, cold and lonely way to spend all of eternity. The scene is dominated by gray and devoid of any bright colors. --- 35
			A motley crew of dejected and spent car tires while away their final days in this retirement home. One old geezer stands out from the crowd. An odd angle lends a rather surreal quality to this scene. --- 140
			A muffled sun shines through on overcast wintery sky in San Mateo, California. Its dimmed soft and warm glow is enclosed by the twisted branches of a leafless tree, which appear as cracks in a window. --- 189
			A parking lot sign in Ferndale, California takes on a deep existential meaning when it is taken out of context. Perhaps the human body is no more than a visitor\'s parking space to be temporarily used? --- 98
			A row of windows on a building in San Francisco, California provides a perfect subject for an abstract perspective piece that plays with lines. The angle suggests a leaning building and adds tension. --- 231
			A rusty old corrugated iron wall is taken out of context to create a perspective abstract. The perspective lines of one corrugated panel\'s ridges draw your eye to where that panel meets another panel. --- 42
			A rusty old crank taken out of context makes you wonder what would be moved by turning it and makes its appearance ever the more mysterious. --- 49
			A silhouetted stand of tall leafless trees meet the eerily iridescent winter sky in Metuchen, New Jersey. A sleak plane of clouds thinly blankets the glowing and silvery aqua sky. --- 203
			A single lonely hook is lost amongst a matrix of bricks. An outdoor lamp dimly lights the nighttime air and casts a gold hue over the scene. The unused hook stands out like a weed in a dirt field. --- 84
			A small group of conifers huddle closely together, silhouetted like obelisks against an imposing sky. The mid afternoon sun is obscured by clouds that seem to emanate from some spot behind the trees. --- 91
			A solitary plant is the only companion to this sunset seen from a Milagra Ridge hillside in Pacifica, California. The sunset seems to mirror the plant\'s form, with the path of lit ocean like its stem. Milagra Ridge is part of the Golden Gate National Recreational Area, and is a favorite hiking spot. --- 28
			A wave starts to break at the rust-stained concrete Pacifica Pier. In the foreground, the frothy remains of an earlier wave break churns away. The dramatic winter sky looks ready to burst with rain. --- 126
			A wave that is meeting the shore is taken completely out of context to produce an abstract. Color depth and detail are reduced to further strengthen the composition, while the awkward angle confounds. --- 224
			A windswept tree stands lonely on a lush green hillside. Captured while hiking one afternoon at Milagra Ridge, Pacifica. --- 238
			An aerial view of a flock of fluffy white clouds travelling across the oceans of the Caribbean. The beautiful turquoise water is so clear and the landmass so shallow that you can see the sand banks. --- 63
			An intimate patch of wet pebbled ground is lighted by the dull winter sun in Metuchen, New Jersey. Fallen autumn leaves are scattered sparsely about in this scene dominated by various shades of brown. --- 14
			Braving the Onslaught --- 18
			By the Seaside --- 103
			Companion to a Sunset --- 25
			Crank it Up --- 46
			Driving Through the Rain --- 53
			Fallen autumn leaves drown in the pooling winter rainwater of a muddy forest floor in Metuchen, New Jersey, and are overlayed on the reflections of slender leafless trees in some kind of ironic twist. --- 133
			Flock of Clouds --- 60
			Hail to the Opening --- 67
			Hook in the Wall --- 81
			Just a Visitor --- 95
			On the island of St. Croix, in the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Caribbean, a sad and delapidated structure stands deserted in a neighborhood that never quite fully recovered from the many insults of hurricanes past. All that remains of a once glorious home is a decaying skeleton that serves as a cautious reminder to those who still live in its midst. --- 168
			One lonely tree on a hillside faces the onslaught of monstrous looming clouds that threaten rain. It leans back, as if in fear. Captured while hiking in the late afternoon at Milagra Ridge, Pacifica. --- 21
			Out the Bus Window --- 109
			Pacifica Pier from Milagra --- 116
			Pacifica Pier is seen from the lower hills of Milagra Ridge in the late afternoon. An approaching bank of clouds mirrors the shape of the shoreline, while fluffy clouds higher up blend with blue. --- 119
			Partially rusted steel reinforcing bars are heaped against each other to form a huge stack. They lean over, and we see a window into the stack that results in wonderful diagonal lines of rusty blue. --- 175
			Pier Before the Storm --- 123
			Shadow of the Past --- 165
			Stacks of Steel --- 172
			Sun Sets Soon at Sweeney --- 179
			Sun Through a Tree --- 186
			The Pacific ocean gently caresses glistening wet rocks on the pebble beach near Point Bonita lighthouse in Marin (San Francisco Bay Area), California. Small pools of water remain from a previous wave. --- 105
			The setting sun flares through a gap between buildings at the Civic Center in San Francisco, California. Silhouetted buildings evoke mystery, while rows of lights echo the line of the sun flare. --- 147
			The sun bursts out beneath a bank of clouds in this sunset, seen from Sweeney Ridge in San Bruno, California. It casts a path of shimmering orange on the ocean and lights up the air between two hills. --- 182
			The sun sets behind buildings in San Mateo, California, lighting up the unusual clouds with rich colors. The sky is complex, with different levels of clouds that catch the light in different ways. --- 154
			The view through a window of a moving bus at night provides the subject for a motion abstract. The lights outside create streaks while the light from inside reflects on the window as a subtle overlay. --- 112
			The winter sun sets below a dramatic bank of heavy clouds that head an incoming storm, while a solitary tree on a hillside watches on. The ocean is set alight with a path of shimmering orange. --- 161
			Two locks guard the entrance to a deserted building at Fort Cronkite in Marin (San Francisco Bay Area), California. Two openings in the rusted steel door mirror the locks and are suggestive of eyes. --- 210
			Windswept and Alone --- 235
